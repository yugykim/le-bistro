## restaurant webstie 

I developed the restaurant website following by client's needs. It is a website for giving information and explanation about the restaurant. I developed this website by utilizing React, and its libraries which are Framer-motion for animation CSS and parallax for creating scroll effects. 
Those libraries have provided users with a more professional display about the restaurant.
